# jumpycalm-cBot-Grid-V3
This is a grid trading cBot for cTrader
Special thanks to SaifBD for posting the very original code on to ctrader.com, that made the version 1 of the code

Special thanks to Candeias for re-writing the decompiled code to more human readable code which made the version 2 of the code
Many thanks to the folks’ comments on ctrader.com to made improvements on this code.
I re-wrote the code and shorted the code by more than half thanks to the use of System.Linq Namespaces.
This cBot works best with 15 minutes chart. Default parameters are optimized for EURUSD and GBPUSD.
At time of publishing this code, the code only tested on cTrader 3.5 beta. There’s no plan to make the code work on older cTrader version.
